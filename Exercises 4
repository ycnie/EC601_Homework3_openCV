1. Comment on the results.
Adaptive filtering keeps a lot of the same features of the original picture

2. What are the diadvantages of binary threshold?
It losses a lot of information that was originally carried by the picture.As the representation is only a silhouette, 
application is restricted to tasks where internal detail is not required as a distinguishing characteristic.

3. When is Adaptive Threshold useful?
We can apply a lot of thresholds at the same time. So we can gather the advantages of different thresholds while make up for the disadvantages
of each threshold by combining these features together.
